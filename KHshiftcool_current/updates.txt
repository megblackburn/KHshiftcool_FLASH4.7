- error with the boltzmann constant in cool_init - have hard coded in value as it gave T_ zero from calculating other KelvinPerKeV with KB
- also changed out the Lambda_ = 0.0 to 0.01 as divide by 0 error, LambdaH_ had last 2 values in array = 0.0 - changed to 0.001
- error with the compute_lambda and simulation_init files - LAMBDA_ has no values 
- in Cool_init write(*,*) "LambdaC_", Lambda - line 135 changed to just Lambda_
- can try kk IN instead of OUT in compute_lambda - no
- added use Cool_init to Simulation_init - didnt work
- changed boltzmann constant back to cl_Boltzmann and it has run 
- set useCool = .true. in flash.par - only had 1 output file (checked pattern)
- set cl_useCoolExactInt = .true. in flash.par


KHsedovcool 09.08.23
- changed flash.par: 
		sim_tempLo = 1.0e6 from 180
		sim_tempUp = 1.0e4 from 18
		sim_rhoLo  = 1.67e-24 from 1
		sim_rhoUp  = 1.67e-26 from 10
		sim_cloudTemp = 1e4 from 4e4
		checkpointFileIntervalStep = 1 from 0 - for debugging
		nend            = 10 from 10000
- changes Sim_initBlock:
		pressure was changed to inclue amu and wmu
		added boltzmann constant, sim_amu, sim_wmu and sim_yp
- changes sim_init:
		got boltzmann constant
		added sim_amu, sim_wmu and sim_yp

KHsedovcool 14.08.23 
- tried changing densities as this causes the error - no dts shown in .out file
		got rid of warning and gave dt values in .out file which increased as expected when cooling is on but results are 
		just uniform no change
		when densities are correct (Ryans values) gives warning in .out file and no dt values - and the same wrong output 
		like in plots11
- changed 1d0 to 1.0 in Cool_exact_integrate

18.08.23
- added sim_velx to sim, set in flash.par, scaling factor for vely and velocity for velx
- velz set = to velx 
- temperature range wanted = ~100-10^6 K
- change the density parameter
- consider incorporating Damkohler number

KHsedovcool 23.08.23
- changes:
	cfl = 0.2 from 0.8
	dtmax = 1.e30 added to flash.par
	lrefine_min = value of lrefine_max
	lrefine_min/max both set to 4 (max was at 6)
	nrefs = 1000000 added to flash.par 
	order = 2 from 3 in flash.par 	
	slopeLimiter = "minmod" from "mc" in .par


shiftcool 24.08.23
- shift directory made 23/08
- changed velocities and min/max to y from z
- changed the sim_tempHot to sim_tempCold in the c_s equation
- added global* to the top outside forloops and ==0.0
- added front_posn_new = sim_yMin outside for loops also
- changed CALL to call in MPI_ALLREDUCE Lines
- added all lines until front_velocity into for loops
- added Driver_shift as an interface in Driver_interface (copied from object dir after ./setup)
- added Driver_shift to Driver_evolveFlash in Driver_interface, ONLY section and then called the function
- removed the blockId from the function following format of Driver_moveToCloudFrame
- changed all blockId to blkID and used correct call functions to get the coords
- need to recompile and run again tomorrow (25/08) (latest change is c_s equation sim_tempCold

KHshiftcool_current (previously shiftcool2) 25.08.23
- commented out front_posn_new = sim_yMin - posn_new only defined within do loop now
- changed temperature equation /kb_mu_mp from *kb_mu_mp (this is wrong in the athena and athena++ from github)
- changed volume equation
- defined dx, dy from the getDeltas(blkID, del) function
- changed global and cell volumes to areas? 2 dims, global volume works as z limits are real, but dz is 0 so cell volume is 0 
- put do loops inside the if time>shift_start statement - doesn't appear to work as no output from Driver_s is shown
- ADD WRITE DR_SIMTIME!! and some statements before/after if statement

KHshiftcool_current 27.08.23
- call to Driver_s in Driver_evolveFlash was outside do loop -  moved inside and is now working
- call for Timers_start/Stop(Driver_s) throws error so were taken out
- seems to run correctly now --> runs27823/KHshiftcool_current/att5 first successful attempt i think (timed out but output file looks correct - need to check placements of chk file writes and Driver ones??)
- added solnData to Simulation_init
- took out the if time statement - can put back in 
- Driver_s does run but when it starts running the outputs stop ???

KHshiftcool_current 28.08.23
- added in shift_start if statement
- changed between blkLimitsGC and blkLimits - GC includes ghost cells
- took out eos statement - no difference
- moved solnData call inside do loop - no difference
- runs until the shift starts then only outputs the chk file after the first run of frame shift - unsure if the frame has shifted in the last chk file but it does run
- variables all seem like feasible values so far
